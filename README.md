# VIRACV2_cat_search

VIRAC V2 project search code.

The VIRAC project focuses on collecting astrometric and proper motion data to track
the motion of stars in the inner regions of the Milky Way. While the VIRAC V1 data
has already been made publicly available, the VIRAC V2 data is still unreleased. In this
project, we utilize the non-public VIRAC V2 data to develop a user-friendly script for a more
accessible search and exploration of the survey data.

The main objective of this project is to create a script that allows users to enter specific
coordinates and a search radius to perform specific searches within a data set. In addition,
the script incorporates a visualization function that allows users to explore and analyze the
data visually.
